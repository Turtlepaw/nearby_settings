# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 4/29/2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes how our app ("we", "us", or "our") handles user information.

### 1. No Personal Data Collection

Our app does not collect, store, or share any personal information. All data entered or viewed through the app is handled locally and temporarily on your device.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Communication Only

The app uses Google Play Services’ Nearby Connections API to enable communication with nearby devices (such as a TV). These connections are local and direct (peer-to-peer). The app does not transmit any data over the internet, nor does it connect to any external servers.

### 3. Data Storage

All user-entered data is stored exclusively on the nearby device (e.g. TV), which hosts the original schema and database. The mobile app serves only as a temporary interface for interacting with this data and does not retain any data after the session ends.

### 4. No Analytics or Tracking

We do not use analytics tools, crash reporting services, or collect device identifiers. Your use of the app is not tracked in any way.

### 5. Children’s Privacy

This app is not directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of the policy. Continued use of the app after any updates indicates acceptance of the changes.

### 7. Contact
