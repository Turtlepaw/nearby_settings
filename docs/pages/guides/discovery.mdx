# User Discovery

Users may not know that your app supports Nearby Settings. To help users discover Nearby Settings, you can add a `NearbySettingsDiscovery` in your app to help users discover Nearby Settings.

## Add a discovery card

This will render the QR code and download link. If you'd like to have it in a dialog, use `NearbySettingsDiscoveryDialog`.

```kotlin
// Discovery card (QR code and download link)
NearbySettingsDiscovery()

// Dialog version
NearbySettingsDiscoveryDialog {
    // dismiss the dialog
}
```

That's all you need to do to make this UI appear in your app.
