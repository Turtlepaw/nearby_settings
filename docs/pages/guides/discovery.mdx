# User Discovery

Users may not know that your app supports Nearby Settings. To help users discover Nearby Settings, you can add a `NearbySettingsDiscovery` in your app to help users discover Nearby Settings.

## Add a discovery card

```kotlin
NearbySettingsDiscovery()
```

That's all you need to do to make this UI appear in your app.
