# User Discovery

Users may not know that your app supports Nearby Settings. To help users discover Nearby Settings, you can add a `DiscoveryDialog` in your app to help users discover Nearby Settings.

## Add a Discovery Dialog

```kotlin
DiscoveryDialog()
```

That's all you need to do to make this UI appear in your app.
