# Permissions

Nearby Connections requires several permissions to function, you can easily request these permissions in your Jetpack Compose app using the [`accompanist-permissions`](https://google.github.io/accompanist/permissions/) library and Nearby Setting's `rememberRequiredPermissions` function.

### Add accompanist permissions as a dependency

```kts {3}
dependencies {
    // Add accompanist-permissions dependency
    implementation("com.google.accompanist:accompanist-permissions:0.37.0")
}
```

### Use `rememberRequiredPermissions` to request permissions

```kotlin
val permissions = rememberRequiredPermissions {}

// Request all required permissions
permissions.launchMultiplePermissionRequest()
```
