# Permissions

Nearby Connections requires several permissions to function, you can easily request these permissions in your Jetpack Compose app using the [`accompanist-permissions`](https://google.github.io/accompanist/permissions/) library and Nearby Setting's `rememberRequiredPermissions` function.

### Add accompanist permissions as a dependency

```kts {3}
dependencies {
    // Add accompanist-permissions dependency
    implementation("com.google.accompanist:accompanist-permissions:0.37.0")
}
```

### Use `rememberNearbyPermissions` to request permissions

```kotlin
val permissions = rememberNearbyPermissions(
    // If true (default), a permission dialog will be shown before launching the permissions request
    dialog = true,
    // If true (default), the permissions will be requested when rememberNearbyPermissions is called
    launchPermissionsOnStart = true,
    // Callback for when the permissions are changed
    onPermissionsResult = {}
)

// Request all required permissions
// If `launchPermissionsOnStart` is true, this will be called automatically
permissions.launchMultiplePermissionRequest()
```
